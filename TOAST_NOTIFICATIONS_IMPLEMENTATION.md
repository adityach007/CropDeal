# Toast Notifications Implementation

## Overview
Toast notifications have been successfully implemented across the CropDeal application using Angular Material's MatSnackBar component.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Toast Service (`toast.service.ts`)
Created a centralized toast service with four notification types:
- **Success** (green) - For successful operations
- **Error** (red) - For failed operations
- **Info** (blue) - For informational messages
- **Warning** (orange) - For warning messages

### 2. Global Styles
Added custom toast styles in `styles.css`:
- Gradient backgrounds for each toast type
- Custom positioning (top-right)
- Shadow effects for better visibility
- Consistent styling with the app's design system

### 3. App Configuration
Updated `app.config.ts` to include:
- `provideAnimations()` - Required for Angular Material animations

## Components Updated

### 1. **Manage Crops Component**
Toast notifications for:
- ✅ Crop added successfully
- ✅ Crop updated successfully
- ✅ Crop deleted successfully
- ❌ Failed to load/add/update/delete crops

### 2. **Admin Dashboard Component**
Toast notifications for:
- ✅ Farmer status updated (activated/deactivated)
- ✅ Dealer status updated (activated/deactivated)
- ❌ Failed to update farmer/dealer status

### 3. **Browse Crops Component**
Toast notifications for:
- ✅ Review submitted successfully
- ❌ Failed to submit review

### 4. **Manage Purchase Requests Component**
Toast notifications for:
- ✅ Purchase confirmed successfully
- ❌ Failed to confirm purchase

### 5. **Login Component**
Toast notifications for:
- ✅ Login successful
- ❌ Invalid credentials
- ❌ Login error

### 6. **Register Component**
Toast notifications for:
- ✅ Registration successful
- ❌ Registration error

### 7. **Payment Component**
Toast notifications for:
- ℹ️ Redirecting to payment gateway
- ❌ Failed to create payment

## Usage Examples

### Success Toast
```typescript
this.toast.success('Crop added successfully!');
```

### Error Toast
```typescript
this.toast.error('Failed to add crop');
```

### Info Toast
```typescript
this.toast.info('Redirecting to payment gateway...');
```

### Warning Toast
```typescript
this.toast.warning('Please complete your profile');
```

## Features

1. **Auto-dismiss**: Toasts automatically disappear after 3-4 seconds
2. **Positioned**: All toasts appear at the top-right corner
3. **Styled**: Custom gradient backgrounds matching the app theme
4. **Accessible**: Includes action buttons (✓, ✕, ℹ, ⚠)
5. **Non-intrusive**: Doesn't block user interaction

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users get immediate feedback on their actions
2. **Consistent**: All notifications follow the same pattern
3. **Professional**: Modern, polished appearance
4. **Maintainable**: Centralized service makes updates easy
5. **No Backend Changes**: Works with existing API responses

## Testing

To test the toast notifications:

1. **Crop Management**:
   - Add a new crop → See success toast
   - Edit a crop → See success toast
   - Delete a crop → See success toast

2. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Toggle farmer status → See success toast
   - Toggle dealer status → See success toast

3. **Authentication**:
   - Login with valid credentials → See success toast
   - Login with invalid credentials → See error toast
   - Register new account → See success toast

4. **Purchase Management**:

   - Submit a review → See success toast

5. **Payment**:

## Notes

- No backend code was modified as requested
- All toasts are client-side only
- The service is injectable and can be used in any component
- Toast duration can be adjusted in the service if needed
